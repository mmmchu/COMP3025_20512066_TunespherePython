# üéµ TuneSphere: Music Sheet to MIDI Conversion App

**TuneSphere** is a cross-platform mobile application that transforms sheet music in PDF format into playable MIDI files. Using advanced Optical Music Recognition (OMR) techniques, it extracts musical elements from PDF sheet music and converts them into MIDI, playable directly within the app. The generated MIDI files are stored in a user-friendly **Library** for easy management.

## üì¶  Libraries Used

### Flutter (Frontend)
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile app development framework.
- **Dart**: Programming language for app logic.
- **Packages**:
    - `file_picker`: Select PDF files from device storage.
    - `http`: Communicate with the Python backend.
    - `just_audio`: Play MIDI files after conversion.
    - `shared_preferences`: Store and retrieve user data (MIDI file metadata).
    - `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer`: Display PDF files before conversion.

### Python (Backend)
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework to handle PDF uploads and MIDI generation.
- **Libraries**:
    - `Pillow (PIL)`: Image loading and preprocessing.
    - `NumPy`: Numerical operations on images.
    - `OpenCV (cv2)`: Advanced image processing (thresholding, contour detection, etc.).
    - `PyMuPDF (fitz)`: PDF file extraction and processing.
    - `Mido`: MIDI file generation based on detected notes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Image Preprocessing and OMR Methodology

The conversion from sheet music to MIDI follows these main steps:

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Simplify the PDF to grayscale images.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Apply Gaussian adaptive thresholding to binarise images.
- **Staff Line Removal**: Detect and remove staff lines using horizontal projection profiles.
- **Clef Detection**: Identify clefs using blob detection and morphological operations.
- **Notehead Detection**: Detect filled and hollow noteheads with morphological filtering and blob detection.
- **Beam and Stem Detection**: Detect connected note beams and vertical stems using erosion, dilation, and Hough transforms.
- **Bar Line Detection**: Detect measure separators for structure.
- **Notehead Classification**: Classify note types (e.g., quaver, crotchet) based on shape, fill, and context.
- **Pitch Identification**: Determine pitches relative to staff positions.

### 2. MIDI File Generation
Detected notes are mapped to MIDI pitches and rhythms. The MIDI file is constructed using the `mido` library to encode timing, pitch, and note duration.

### 3. Post-Processing Validation
Manual and automated checks ensure that the resulting MIDI matches the intended musical notation.
